# Credit Card Users Churn Prediction
Domain: Banking & Finance

### Description:
Developed a machine learning classification model for Thera Bank to predict customer attrition in credit card services. The objective was to identify customers likely to discontinue their credit cards and uncover key factors influencing churn, helping the bank reduce revenue loss and improve customer retention.

The project involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building using Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. To handle class imbalance, techniques like upsampling and downsampling were applied, with evaluation focused on maximizing recall score to minimize false negatives (missed churn cases). Hyperparameter tuning was performed on the best models to enhance predictive accuracy.

### Key Contributions:

Performed data cleaning, encoding, and imputation for categorical and missing values.

Conducted univariate and multivariate analysis to identify churn drivers such as inactivity, low transaction frequency, and utilization ratio.

Built and compared multiple ML models, focusing on recall optimization.

Applied class balancing techniques (upsampling/downsampling) to improve churn detection.

Tuned hyperparameters and deployed the final model with pickle serialization for future use.

Provided business recommendations to improve retention, such as targeted offers for inactive customers and better credit utilization management.
