# Customer, Revenue, and Shipping Analytics using SQL

### Description:
Designed and implemented complex SQL queries to analyze customer behavior, revenue trends, and shipping performance for a retail/automotive business dataset. The project focused on answering key business questions related to customer distribution, feedback analysis, vehicle preferences, revenue growth, and operational efficiency.

The solution leveraged CTEs, window functions (RANK, LAG), aggregate functions, and joins to generate actionable insights, including:

Customer Analytics: Distribution across states, customer satisfaction trends, churn indicators, and preferred vehicle makers.

Revenue & Orders: Quarterly order trends, net revenue analysis, and quarter-over-quarter revenue growth using LAG for time-series comparisons.

Shipping Insights: Average discounts by credit card type and quarterly average shipping times.

### Key Contributions:

Wrote optimized SQL queries using joins, subqueries, and window functions to derive business insights.

Built KPIs such as QoQ revenue growth, customer feedback percentages, and order trends.

Applied classical BI-style analytics in SQL for decision-making support.

Delivered structured reports that provided insights into customer satisfaction, product demand, and logistics performance.
