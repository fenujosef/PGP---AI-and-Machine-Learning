# New-Wheels Quarterly Business Report – SQL & Data Analytics

## Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing business performance for New-Wheels, a vehicle resale company, by answering critical business questions and creating a Quarterly Business Report (QBR). The analysis was conducted using MySQL and visualized using Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn) and Excel, based on a relational database that included customer, vehicle, order, and shipping details.

## Problem Statement:

New-Wheels has experienced a steady decline in sales and customer acquisition due to poor after-sales feedback. The leadership team requires data-driven insights into customer behavior, revenue trends, and shipping performance to make strategic decisions and improve overall business health.

## Solution Approach:

✔ Database Setup: Imported the provided SQL dump file into MySQL and explored the schema (ER diagram included in the repo).
✔ SQL Analysis: Designed and implemented optimized SQL queries to answer key business questions related to:

Customer Analytics: Geographic distribution, churn indicators, and satisfaction trends.

Revenue & Orders: Quarterly revenue, QoQ growth analysis, and order volume trends using window functions (LAG, RANK).

Shipping Performance: Average delivery time and discount analysis by payment type.
✔ KPIs & Reports: Generated KPIs such as revenue growth, customer retention metrics, and average shipping time, and compiled results into a Quarterly Business Report.
✔ Visualizations: Created dashboards and charts in Python and Excel to present insights clearly to stakeholders.

## Tech Stack:
