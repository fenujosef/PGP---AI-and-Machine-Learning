# Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing U.S. honey production data from 1998 to 2012 to understand trends, challenges, and market dynamics within the honey industry. The dataset includes key variables such as the number of honey-producing colonies, yield per colony, total production, stocks, price per pound, and production value.

The study aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical evaluations to uncover insights into supply-demand patterns, colony health, production decline, and the economic impact on the honey industry. With the context of Colony Collapse Disorder and its effects on bee populations, the project provides a data-driven perspective on how honey production and pricing have evolved over time and how the industryâ€™s dependency on imports has grown.

## Key Goals:

Analyze trends in honey production and colony counts across U.S. states.

Examine the effect of declining bee populations on yield and production.

Study the relationship between production, stocks, and pricing.

Identify long-term shifts in domestic production versus growing reliance on imports.

Provide visual and statistical insights to better understand the agricultural and economic implications.
