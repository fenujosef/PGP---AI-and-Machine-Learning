# ðŸ“Œ AI & Machine Learning Projects â€“ Post Graduate Program
This repository showcases a collection of end-to-end projects completed as part of my Post Graduate Program in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from the University of Texas at Austin.

The projects span across multiple domains such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Predictive Analytics, reflecting the practical application of AI/ML techniques to solve real-world problems. Each module includes detailed problem statements, objectives, data dictionaries, and implementation steps, providing a comprehensive view of my learning journey.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Domains Covered
Computer Vision â€“ Face detection, recognition, and image classification

Natural Language Processing (NLP) â€“ Sentiment analysis, text classification, and stock prediction

Deep Learning â€“ Neural networks, CNNs, LSTMs, and digit recognition (SVHN, MNIST variations)

Predictive Modeling & Analytics â€“ Agriculture production analysis, signal quality prediction, and financial data forecasting

## ðŸŽ¯ Highlights
Hands-on implementation of ML/DL models using Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn

Application of EDA, statistical analysis, and feature engineering for structured datasets

Experience with real-world datasets (financial news, honey production, street-view house numbers, facial datasets)

Deployment-ready, modular code structure with clear documentation

#### ðŸ’¡ This repository serves both as a learning archive and as a portfolio of AI/ML projects, demonstrating my skills in building data-driven, AI-powered solutions across diverse industries.
